# Chat Server

## Setup instructions

The Chat application is deployed to Heroku. You can test the chat visiting the following links:

User 1: http://localhost:3000/chat?userName=FirstUser&chatRoom=doclerRoom
User 2: http://localhost:3000/chat?userName=SecondUser&chatRoom=doclerRoom

Or you can clone the code from the repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```

After all of the components are installed run the following in terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

The Chat Frontend repository is located here:

https://github.com/edgarmkrtchyan/chat-frontend

To run it locally you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine and run:

```bash
npm install
```

After all of the components are installed run the following in terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

Once both front-end and server components are installed and run on local machine you will be able to use the Chat visiting the following links (given port 3000 was not busy on your machine when you run npm start for front-end, then you should change the port in the links below to the one the application runs on your machine):

User 1: http://localhost:3000/chat?userName=FirstUser&chatRoom=doclerRoom
User 2: http://localhost:3000/chat?userName=SecondUser&chatRoom=doclerRoom
